  #       D = dimension of each ensemble member.
  #    y: numeric vector of length `P`, where `P` is the observation dimension. 
  #       This vector is the observation being conditioned on. 
  #    Y: matrix of shape (J,P), the ensemble of "simulated observations" that 
  #       are subtracted from the true observation `y` in the update equation.
  #    C_uy: matrix of shape (D,P), the cross-covariance matrix used in the 
  #          update equation. 
  #    C_y: matrix of shape (P,P), the "y" part of the covariance. Optional if 
  #         its Cholesky factor `L_y` is provided.

run_eki_step <- function(U, y, G, Sig) {
  # Computes one iteration of Ensemble Kalman inversion, which involves 
  # computing the sample mean and covariance estimates using the current 
  # ensembles, and then calling `compute_enkf_update()`. This function assumes
  # that the forward model has already run at the ensemble members `U`, with 
  # the corresponding outputs provided by `G`. At present, this function 
  # assumes that the inverse problem has a Gaussian likelihood with covariance 
  # `Sig`, but this can potentially be generalized in the future. To be explicit,
  # the current assumption is an additive Gaussian noise model, with independent
  # noise eps ~ N(0,Sig). Note that no parameter transformations are performed
  # here; see `run_eki()` for such transformations.

  #       This vector is the observation being conditioned on.
  #    G: matrix of shape (J,P), storing the results of the forward model runs 
  #       evaluated at the ensemble members `U`. 
  #    Sig: matrix of shape (P,P), the covariance matrix for the Gaussian 
  #         likelihood.

  #            approximation.

  #     `C_u`: the estimated covariance for the "u" part.
